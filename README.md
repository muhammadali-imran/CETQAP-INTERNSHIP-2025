# CETQAP-INTERNSHIP-2025
This repository contains my 4-weeks internship research work at CETQAP, focused on the basics of quantum computing and research. It includes simple implementations of qubits, gates, and core concepts like superposition and entanglement, serving as a foundation for future quantum exploration.
